## __Overview of Project__
Kickstarter is one of the most lucrative online crowdfunding platforms to date, it is however an uncompromising one. A campaign has to meet its set goal otherwise you would be back to square one, raising money all over again even if it is only a dollar short.

### __Purpose__
With that in mind, it is important for anyone starting a Kickstarter campaign to have a better understanding of how successful campaigns are made. For this analysis, we are analyzing campaign outcomes, specifically for the category of __Theatre__ based on their __Launch Date & Goals__. 

## __Analysis and Challenges__

### __Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date__

Based on the Launched Date Outcomes, out of __1369__ Theatre campaigns, a total of __839__ were successful, giving it a __61%__ success rate while __36%__ failed & __3%__ were canceled. On a monthly breakdown, successful Theatre campaigns are generally higher than failed & canceled campaigns combined. Those that were launched on the 2nd quarter of a year were highly successful, particularly __May__, which had the highest percentage of __67%__ successful outcomes. While those launched in December had the highest percentage of __47%__ failed outcomes.

### __Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals__

To get a better understanding of Theatre Outcomes based on its Goal, we have categorized each campaign's goal into an intervals of $5,000. We set a starting point of _'Less than $1,000'_ until _'Greater than $50,000'_. Based on the data, those campaigns with a set goal of __$5,000 or less__ have have the highest chances of success and tend to get lower the higher the goal. A total of __529__ successful campaigns are attributed to the first two ranges of the data.

### __Challenges and Difficulties Encountered__
Basing success factors on campaign Goals percentages might not be entirely accurate as the number of Total Projects are generally lower on higher set goals. Delving deeper into donation amounts and number of backers per campaign will give us a better understanding on where to set a campaign's goal in order for it to be successful. However, knowing when to launch a Theatre campaign is imperative for anyone who wants their work on the stage.

## __Results__

- It highly recommend to launch a Theatre campaign on __May or June__ but never launch on __November or December__ as the spread between success and failure is close to null on these months.

- Set a campaign Goal of less than __$5,000__ for higher chances of success in the Theatre category.

- Launched date based on year might not be accurate as political and socioeconimic events of a year might affect backing trends on particular topics or audience reach (e.g. COVID, geopolitical, racial & gender equality movements)

- Knowing which subcategories are actually successful in the Theatre Category will be helpful.

- Outcomes based on Pledged Amount vs. Average Number of backers might give us a better understanding on _'How'_ campaigns are successful.
